# Measurement of dichroic mirror offsets

## Image acquisition

Images of fluorescent microspheres (beads) were acquired using 
sequential scans using the 405nm laser and each objective in turn. Two 
sequential scan configurations were used: (i) DMs 1, 2 and 3; (ii) DMs 
1, 4 and 5. For further information on imaging parameters, please 
consult image file metadata.

All images used to measure dichroic offsets are available on figshare.
