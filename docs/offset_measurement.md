# Measurement of dichroic mirror (DM) offsets

## Image acquisition

Images of fluorescent microspheres (beads) were acquired using 
sequential scans using the 405nm laser and each objective in turn. 
Two sequential scan configurations were used: (i) DMs 1, 2 and 3; 
(ii) DMs 1, 4 and 5. Images were saved in Olympus oir format (one 
file per sequential scan). For further information on imaging 
parameters, please consult image file metadata.

All images used to measure DM offsets are available on figshare.
